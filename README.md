Rawr.WarlockSim
===============

This project models complex gameplay mechanics via discrete event simulation and a dynamic priority event queue system.


It was built as a plugin for [Rawr](http://rawr.codeplex.com/), a theorycrafting tool for the popular MMO [World Of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/).

NOTE: It is not currently compatible with the latest version of Rawr.
